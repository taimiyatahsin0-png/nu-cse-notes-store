## 2. Must-know definitions

### 2.1 Alternating Current (AC)

**বাংলা:** যে electric current-এর মান এবং দিক সময়ের সঙ্গে পর্যায়ক্রমে পরিবর্তিত হয়, তাকে Alternating Current বলে।

**English exam answer:** Alternating current is an electric current whose magnitude and direction change periodically with time.

### 2.2 Frequency

**বাংলা:** প্রতি সেকেন্ডে সম্পন্ন পূর্ণ cycle-এর সংখ্যাই frequency।

**English exam answer:** Frequency is the number of complete cycles of a periodic quantity per second.

- Symbol: (f)
- Unit: hertz (Hz)
- Relation: (f=1/T)

### 2.3 Time Period

**বাংলা:** একটি পূর্ণ cycle সম্পন্ন করতে যে সময় লাগে, তাকে time period বলে।

**English exam answer:** The time required to complete one full cycle of a periodic quantity is called its time period.

- Symbol: (T)
- Unit: second (s)
- Relation: (T=1/f)

### 2.4 RMS Value

**বাংলা:** একই resistance-এ একই সময়ে যে DC current বা voltage সমান heating effect তৈরি করে, সেটিই AC quantity-এর RMS-equivalent value।

**English exam answer:** The RMS value of an alternating quantity is the equivalent DC value that produces the same heating effect in a given resistance over the same period.

For a sine wave:
[
V_{rms}=\frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707V_m
\]
[
I_{rms}=\frac{I_m}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707I_m
\]

### 2.5 Form Factor

**বাংলা:** RMS value এবং average rectified value-এর অনুপাতকে form factor বলে।

**English exam answer:** Form factor is the ratio of the RMS value to the average rectified value of an alternating quantity.

For a sine wave:
[
K_f=\frac{V_{rms}}{V_{avg,rect}}
=\frac{0.707V_m}{0.637V_m}
\approx 1.11
\]

### 2.6 Resonance in a Series RLC Circuit

**বাংলা:** Series RLC circuit-এ যে frequency-তে inductive reactance ও capacitive reactance সমান হয়, সেই অবস্থাকে resonance বলে।

**English exam answer:** Series resonance occurs when the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance.

[
X_L=X_C

## 3. Important derivations

### 3.1 Derivation of RMS value of a sinusoidal voltage

ধরি, একটি sinusoidal voltage:
[
v=V_m\sin\theta
\]

RMS-এর সংজ্ঞা অনুযায়ী,
[
V_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}v^2\,d\theta}
\]

মান বসিয়ে,
[
V_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}V_m^2\sin^2\theta\,d\theta}
\]

ধ্রুবক বাইরে নিলে,
[
V_{rms}=V_m\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\sin^2\theta\,d\theta}
\]

একটি পূর্ণ cycle-এ (\sin^2\theta)-এর গড় মান (1/2)। সুতরাং,
[
V_{rms}=V_m\sqrt{\frac12}
=\frac{V_m}{\sqrt2}
\]

অতএব,
[
\boxed{V_{rms}=0.707V_m}
\]

**Exam tip:** Definition → general formula → substitute sine expression → integrate/average → final boxed result. ধাপগুলো পরিষ্কারভাবে লিখবে।

### 3.2 Derivation of average value of a sine wave over a half-cycle

ধরি,
[
v=V_m\sin\theta
\]

Positive half-cycle-এর average value:
[
V_{avg}=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi}V_m\sin\theta\,d\theta
\]

[
=\frac{V_m}{\pi}[-\cos\theta]_0^{\pi}
\]

[
=\frac{V_m}{\pi}[1-(-1)]
=\frac{2V_m}{\pi}
\]

অতএব,
[
\boxed{V_{avg}=0.637V_m}
\]

**Remember:** একটি পূর্ণ symmetrical sine-wave cycle-এর average value শূন্য। (0.637V_m) হলো half-cycle average বা full-wave rectified average।

### 3.3 Impedance of a series RLC circuit

Series RLC circuit-এ resistance (R) এবং net reactance ((X_L-X_C)) পরস্পরের সঙ্গে phasor-এ perpendicular।

তাই impedance-এর মান:
[
\boxed{Z=\sqrt{R^2+(X_L-X_C)^2}}
\]

এবং supply voltage (V) হলে,
[
\boxed{I=\frac{V}{Z}}
\]
